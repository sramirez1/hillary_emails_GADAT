aVcouncil foreign relations expert brief china economic relationship separating facts myths steven dunaway adjunct senior fellow international economics author former deputy director asia pacific department international monetary fund author council special report global imbalances financial crisis many myths surround economic relationship united states china four particular stand important identify myths avoid misunderstandings adversely influence policy decisions fact china become largest foreign holder government securities taken indicating united states heavily dependent china finance budget deficits similarly since china major source imports consumers seen dependent cheap chinese goods addition chinese authorities emphasized strongly resist external pressures try influence policy decisions economic instability china bad adverse implications rest world taken together four myths lead conclusion china pushed hard united states major countries quickly change policies especially exchange rate policy facilitate rebalancing economy conclusion major mistake trip asia president barack obama needs dispel myths bring pressure bear faster economic policy changes china keeping objectives dealing global imbalances laid summit pittsburgh myth washington limited leverage china main banker united states china holds large amount government securities china trillion official reserves estimated percent held dollar assets china big customer debt america banker united states dependent china finance budget deficits china elects buy treasuries willing public private sector buyers indicated strong demand securities worldwide although government pay higher interest rates incentive get investors buy treasuries event chinese reduce demand increase interest rates likely small major consequences decision china reduce purchases treasury securities depend reason behind decision china best interest beneficial rest world well china reduced purchases treasuries decided stop heavily managing exchange rate allow greater flexibility currency movements important policy change required china going rebalance economy able sustain rapid growth china big customer debt america banker united states dependent china finance budget deficits instead china continues heavily manage exchange rate build large additional amounts official reserves decides hold less additional reserves treasury securities china increase purchases assets denominated currencies euro denominated securities likely alternative circumstances china continue intervene exchange market central bank buying dollars chinese renminbi selling dollars euro acquire european assets result appreciation euro consequently countries europe united states probably affected china move negative impact euro appreciation european economic activity likely far outweigh effects united states smaller chinese purchases treasuries alternatively china choose start dumping stock securities result appreciation major currencies depending china decide park reserve assets upward pressure interest rates possibility financial market disruptions china dumped dollar assets rapidly however federal reserve limit rise interest rates able ensure adequate liquidity prevent market disruptions decision dump treasuries large effect china country incur substantial capital loss reserve assets chinese authorities deeply concerned loss unlikely decide dump assets fact discussion initiated china regarding need alternative official reserve asset motivated concerns potential losses dollar holdings myth united states heavily dependent cheap chinese goods really true roughly percent imports come china moreover basic types manufactured consumer goods china exports united states clothing textiles footwear toys small appliances etc imported countries produced domestically prices goods substitute products china higher difference costs relatively small competition among producers become fiercer result cost differentials goods china suppliers narrowing dependence actually runs way china highly dependent demand products economic growth china heavily dependent exports although china able achieve percent gdp growth target owing stimulus domestic demand provided government policy actions country struggle meet objective succeeding years demand exports united states pick myth external pressure china policy changes counterproductive chinese authorities stress face external pressure tend strongly resist economic policy changes chinese particular used argument try fend pressures appreciation exchange rate country wants appear weak susceptible external pressure truth pressure less incentive change policy especially true china authorities wedded status quo past success inclined make gradual changes economic policies recent developments china exchange rate illustrate point absence external pressure since china reverted fixing exchange rate relative dollar without hard push united states bilateral multilateral basis changes china policies likely delayed best interest united states rest world myth instability bad china chinese authorities also suggested instability china bad rest world adverse effects china growth rate instability fear instability played big role initiating economic policy changes china example concern instability arising growing gap urban rural incomes major factor behind new initiatives develop china interior develop west program improve conditions opportunities rural population including breaking restrictions discriminatory treatment migrant workers hence china instability necessarily bad problem authorities instability china also necessarily bad rest world effect china growth although china accounts significant portion world gdp growth country generate much demand products countries given china large trade current account surpluses countries asia commodity producers benefiting china strong growth overall providing much stimulus world economy whole slower growth china little effect economic activity rest world important president obama separate fact myth economic policy discussions chinese authorities trip asia build sounder relationship president shy away pushing chinese hard economic reform rebalancing china economy done private discussions china senior leaders multilateral discussions context process much effective forum united states take public stance china economic policies jointly major economies without hard push united states bilateral multilateral basis changes china policies likely delayed best

kissinger variously national security adviser state contrast obama big foreign policy strategist even insiders give different answers asked turns advice big international questions almost agree following observation truth president obama henry kissinger one else plays role says senior official every administration reflects personality president president wants trains barack obama great wall china last year unlike predecessor richard nixon turned henry kissinger advice president big foreign policy strategist routed oval office fifteen months took office character structure obama foreign policy machinery still evolving interviews dozens insiders outsiders including senior officials authorised unauthorised speak three former national security advisers clear buck stops often floats quite long time around obama foreigners complained tendency domestic agenda crowd international one passage last week healthcare reform greeted audible sigh relief among allies within foreign policy centralised structure also result many issues left back burner awaiting presidential attention say critics positive side conscientious president takes advice widely says official debit side president intelligence barack obama came office little experience doesn much depth issues core obama foreign policy machinery white house based national security council advises president ordinates activities across increasingly complex alphabet soup washington departments military commands intelligence agencies widely questioned link chain jim jones many people surprise obama brought national security adviser briefly acquainted obama beforehand general jones retired four star marine corps general shows little interest running inter agency process key part job somewhat unconventionally gen jones travels frequently thus often town unusually obama usually chairs weekly national security council known principals meeting gen jones rahm emanuel obama chief staff also key part ask real national security adviser say three four rehm one gen jones probably least important says another official anyone dealt gen jones speaks highly matter factness geniality respect many foreign governments pakistan israel among admitted rather disarmingly last year taste bureaucracy speaking atlantic council think tank previously worked gen jones provoked laughter said fondly remember atlantic council place people actually asked new role finding order basis negotiation lack strong national security adviser created recurring difficulties perhaps best example arab israeli peace process obama launched

refused accede obama demand officials present emanuel david axelrod senior adviser obama office campaign gen jones fallout put talks abeyance damped high arab hopes obama question bright spark advised

jones obama character also stamped inter agency process set managed tom donilon deputy national security adviser nitty gritty foreign policy making done frequent deputies meetings sometimes consume four six hours day described one insider powerful man white house whose name isn widely known donilon official administration man keeps obama trains running time lot trains last year donilon held deputies meetings workload described clinically insane former senior diplomat bill time goes becoming streamlined taking roughly two three hours day say officials people forget inherited two wars terrorism threats perhaps biggest single eight year decline george bush two terms america power reputation history says senior official took time put place process deal complex decisions take also

senior gerald ford vice president joe biden team also incorporated prevent kind parallel process dick cheney used circumvent bureaucracy george bush look meeting decision war iraq taken cannot find says senior official getting process right improving quality decisions deputies ties back years example families ion jim steinberg deputy state often holiday together donilon wife cathy russell chief

ambassador united nations known since least started administration well since spend half lives together lot work gets done group says flournoy sometimes feels like shovelling coal keep fires going refurbished machinery perhaps evidence build obama decision send another troops afghanistan journey took four months involved hours oval office meetings diligence process crowded obama time focus crises many time precious commodity president says former national security adviser average going minutes day foreign policy want make sure well spent widely expected departure gen jones end year also created rivalries within engine room thought ambitions replace include steinberg rice donilon denis mcdonough nsc chief staff foreign policy official personally closest obama although widely respected none considered big strategic thinker kissinger scowcroft mould described gelb obama lord high executioner mcdonough appended chicago crowd says another official mcdonough widely feared role highlights contradictions obama foreign policy apparatus adviser former senate majority leader tom deschle mcdonough frequently obama side campaign insiders describe enforcer keeper message discipline key element campaign something drastically slow wheels government mcdonough guy campaign one plays basketball president close says official instead jim jones telling mcdonough president thinks way round indeed obama highly centralised foreign policy machine face mcdonough donilon perceived make process inclusive give everyone seat table says david rothkopf former official scholar nsc fairly
